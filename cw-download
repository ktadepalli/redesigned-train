To download and save the CloudWatch Logs to a local file using Python and the `boto3` library, you can modify the code as follows:

```python
import boto3
import time

# Create a CloudWatch Logs client for the eu-west-2 region
client = boto3.client('logs', region_name='eu-west-2')

log_group_name = 'your-log-group-name'
log_stream_name = 'your-log-stream-name'

# Define the time range for October 22, 2023
start_datetime = time.mktime(time.strptime("2023-10-22 00:00:00", "%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S"))  # Start of the day
end_datetime = time.mktime(time.strptime("2023-10-23 00:00:00", "%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S"))  # End of the day

# Convert the datetime objects to timestamps in milliseconds
start_time = int(start_datetime) * 1000
end_time = int(end_datetime) * 1000

# Retrieve log events
response = client.get_log_events(
    logGroupName=log_group_name,
    logStreamName=log_stream_name,
    startTime=start_time,
    endTime=end_time
)

# Create a local file and write the log events to it
with open('logs.txt', 'w') as log_file:
    for event in response['events']:
        log_file.write(event['message'] + '\n')
```

In this code:

1. Replace `'your-log-group-name'` and `'your-log-stream-name'` with the actual names of your CloudWatch log group and log stream.

2. It retrieves log events from the specified log group and log stream within the specified time range.

3. It creates a local file named `'logs.txt'` and writes the log events to this file.

Make sure to install the `boto3` library and configure your AWS credentials and region before running this code. The log events will be saved in the `'logs.txt'` file in your local directory.
